Coding convention notes
=======================

We follow simliar conventions to Xapian, with the exceptions:

 * Header file includes should be done strictly in alphabetical order, with
   the exception that all source files should start with '#include <config.h>',
   followed by 'include "file.h"' for a source file file.cc, if file.h exists.
